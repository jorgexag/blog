# The Why?
Thank you for visiting my [website](https://jorgexag.github.io/) and/or my blog. Just wanted to briefly introduce myself and explain what this is all about. 

My name is Jorge Gonzalez, and at the time of this post, I work as a Professional Services Consultant for a software vendor. I've always had a passion for tech, software, and security. I've been a consultant for various years now, allowing me to sharpen my soft skills and build relationships with exceptional people, but never had the opportunity to really sharpen my hard/technical skills. This is my focus with all of this.

# What to expect?
In the coming months, I plan on building multiple sites/applications. The goal would be to be able to build websites for small businesses and be able to contribute to open-source projects.

Here's a very rough draft on what I plan on doing:
- Learn Figma and web design basics.
- Knock off the rust on my HTML, CSS, & JS skills.
- Learn React or Svelte.
	- I'm really leaning towards Svelte, but React seems to be industry standard.
- Build.

And that's it. I have no idea where this journey is going to take me, but I figured might as well document everything so I can track every road block, advancement, and project completion.
